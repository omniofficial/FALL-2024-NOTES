## What is a Thread?

-   **Thread:** A basic unit of CPU utilization.
-   A thread consists of:

    -   A program var: keeps track of which instruction to execute next.
    -   Register values: store the current working variables.
    -   Stack: keeps track of the program execution history.

-   Thread vs Process:

    -   Process: Used for grouping resources together.
    -   Thread: An entity scheduled for the execution on the CPU.

-   A classical process has a dedicated set of resources and a single thread of control.

-   Multithreading: Allows a process to have mutiple paralles threads of execution.
